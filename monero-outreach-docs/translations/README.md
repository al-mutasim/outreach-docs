# Monero Outreach Translations

If you have any questions regarding the monero terminology, take a look at the [monero-translations](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations), and open the file of the language you are looking for. You can also find tips for translators.

 * Remember to create the directory with your [country code](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes), inside the `translations` directory. You can `Copy` and `paste` the `en` directory and just change the name and start working.

## Goal

Translate as to many languages all the documentation provided by the Monero Outreach Workgroup.

## IMPORTAN

Read the [README_i18.md](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/blob/master/monero-outreach-docs/README_i18n.md) file.

### Fonts

Fonts can be found inside [monero-outreach-docs folder](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/tree/master/monero-outreach-docs/fonts/monero%20fonts) or directly in the site of Monero Outreach - [Monero Typography](https://www.monerooutreach.org/monero-typography.php). _Fonts are actually not needed while using .md file format, but you can use them if you are currently working on any Monero documents, these fonts have been edited by the Monero Outreach Team._
