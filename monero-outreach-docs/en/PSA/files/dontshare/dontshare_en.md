# Never Share Your Private Keys

Your Monero is safe, as long as your private keys and private mnemonic seed is safe. Your private keys and your private mnemonic seed are the only way you can access your wallet and spend/send your XMR. If you share them, then whoever you share them with (or whoever has the technical expertise to steal them from who you share them with) has just as much access to your wallet as you do.

You may think you are doing a good thing by keeping your private keys separate from your physical location, but what if grandma forgets your instructions and leaves them on the windowsill and a stranger walks by and reads (records) them? Then you wake up one morning and all of your XMR was sent to an unfamiliar address. Since Monero is so private, you will have no way of finding out who owns the unfamiliar wallet and you will not be able to recover your missing/stolen XMR.

Sometimes other cryptocurrency projects will hard fork the Monero code then claim you will receive 10x coins, and “all you have to do to claim your 10x coins is share your private keys”. If you come across this, don’t touch it with a 100 foot pole. Not only are they probably trying to scam you, but they also may be trying to compromise the integrity of Monero as a whole. Scammers depend on your greed to do many nefarious things.

### Don’t become a victim.

The only thing you might ever share is your view key — and even then only to prove incoming transactions to your wallet. If that is of no use to you, then don’t share any keys. If someone is claiming they need anything besides your public wallet address (or in some cases your public view key), they are probably attempting to scam you and steal your coins. Long story short, never share your private keys.
