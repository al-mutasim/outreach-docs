# Monero Outreach Transcriptions 

Welcome to the Monero Outreach Transcriptions folder. This is a new section inside the workgroup and we are glad to add more activities.

**How to contribute?** 

We are currently working to transcribe the full video talk for the Monero Konferenco 2019 ([Youtube list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSYUeVwrHBkJHJg_l2uDgbicDJ1PmAVW)) and you will find the `monero-konferenco-2019` folder where you can push your transcriptions. 

We created a [Taiga instance](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/epic/169) for the 2019 Monero Konferenco where you can assign yourself one of the different video conference talks and choose from [Day 1 - Saturday Livestream](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/us/170) or [Day 2 - Sunday Livestream](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/us/171). 

You will also find `breaking_monero` folder with the full [Breaking Monero Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSYUeVwrHBnAUre2G_LYDsdo-tD0ov-y) ready for review and translation. For translating and/or review instructions please read the this [README.md](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/blob/master/README.md). 

**Transcriptions are currently not in our compensation model** 

## Transcriptions

Work the transcription in md (markdown) file format. Make a PR once you finish the transcription and submit it to the Taiga EPIC of the specific transcription instance. If you need help please open a [New issue](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/issues/new) for assistance.
