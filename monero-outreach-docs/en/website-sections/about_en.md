# About Monero Outreach

An Independant Workgroup

We are a team of creators, writers, technicians, translators, and visionaries. Monero Outreach began in June 2018 and has continued to gain new, talented contributors. We are a workgroup of the decentralized Monero community, and as a result we do not claim any level of authority over Monero - we are simply here to follow the mandate that we have set for ourselves, because we love Monero.

## Monero Outreach Mandate 

1. Drive greater Monero adoption and awareness through a variety of outreach-related activities - particularly public relations, education, and marketing.
2. Respect the work done by the Core Developers and community workgroups, the founding principles of Monero, and to the Monero ethos at all turns in the road so we do not jeopardize the integrity of what makes Monero great.
3. Make the world a better place through Monero. We are motivated by the question: "How can we expect to prepare our children to live in this world, if we haven't prepared the world for our children?"
