# News Room 

Monero Outreach is an independent workgroup dedicated to educating people about what Monero offers and how it works. We work with a wide range of media outlets to deliver news and updates about Monero. Press Releases are sent approximately once per month. We send to our contact list the day before releasing publically. If you'd like to be added to our contact list, or have any questions about an existing story, please contact:
