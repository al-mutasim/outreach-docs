# Breaking Monero
*12/21/18*  
_**Exploring potential vulnerabilities, before the bad guys do.**_  

Breaking Monero is a series of episodes by Justin Ehrenhofer, Sarang Noether and Brandon Goodell (Surae Noether) from Monero Research Lab that explain the limitations of Monero’s security and privacy in a comprehensive and understandable way. They give a sneak peek into some of the work done behind the scenes to evaluate risks and to make Monero better. The links below feature each episode, along with a transcription, or you can watch the entire [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSYUeVwrHBnAUre2G_LYDsdo-tD0ov-y). 

#### [01: Introduction](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/introduction.php)
Introduction to the Breaking Monero series.

#### [02: Ring Signatures Introduction](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/ring-signatures.php)
The history of Monero’s ring signatures and past approaches to improve them.

#### [03: 0-Decoy and Chain Reactions](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/decoy-chain-reactions.php)
Sarang and Justin discuss 0-decoy (0-mixin) rings, perhaps the oldest and best-studied past limitation of Monero.

#### [04: Chain Splits (Key Image Reuse Attack)](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/chain-splits.php)
In this episode, Sarang, Brandon (Suare), and Justin introduce key image reuse concerns.

#### [05: Input Selection Algorithm](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/input-selection-algorithm.php)
Sarang and Justin explain more about how Monero selects decoys for ring signatures, more than just “randomly.”

#### [06: Unusual Ringsize](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/unusual-ringsize.php)
Discussing the unfortunate tradeoff when sending Monero transactions with unusual ringsizes.

#### [07: Remote Nodes](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/remote-nodes.php)
The limitations of remote nodes, remote node attacks, and how to mitigate against them.

#### [08: Timing Attacks](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/timing-attacks.php)
Network topography concerns and ways for users to mitigate their exposure to timing heuristics.

#### [09: Poisoned Outputs (EAE Attack)](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/poisoned-outputs.php)
Monero’s ring signatures provide plausible deniability, but they aren’t perfect.

#### [10: Public Mining Pools](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/public-mining-pools.php)
Public mining pools provide a service to miners, but they also reveal a lot of output information that observers can use to learn more about transactions.

#### [11: Mailbag Episode](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/mailbag-episode.php)
Breaking Monero answers questions from audience members.

#### [12: Input/Output Metadata](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/metadata.php)
How the metadata collected by looking at the number of inputs and outputs can limit privacy in some circumstances.

#### [13: Blockchain Explorer OpSec](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/blockchain-explorers.php)
This is a quick reminder to pay attention to the information you give block explorers.
