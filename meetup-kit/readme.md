## Contribute!
This document is part of the Monero Meetup Kit (you can find more informations about it on [Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/sgp-monero-meetup-kit/wiki/home)) and would be great to have it translated in as many languages as possible. Feel free to open an issue if you need help/support.

## Translating the Flyer

1. Fork this repository, so you have your own version on GitHub, then clone your fork locally.
2. Add a folder for your language in `/translations`
3. [download Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/downloads/stable-branch/), an open source tool for document publishing.
4. After you installed Scribus, go in the folder `flyer-scribus-files` and double click on the file `flyer.sla`. A window will pop up, asking to replace the missing `arial regular` font. Substitute this one with `Open Sans Regular` and click ok.
5. Replace the english strings with the ones in your languages
6. When your file is ready, we need to compile it to transform it into a PDF. To do so click on the `File` Menu -> `Export` -> `Save as PDF` -> `Save`
7. Done! now move the resulting pdf inside the folder you created on step
8. push your changes to your remote repository and open a pull request
